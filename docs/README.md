## Adding a Todo

To add a simple to-do task, use the `todo` command followed by the task description.

### Example:

`todo homework`

```
____________________________________________________________
Got it. I've added this task:
  [T][ ] homework
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
____________________________________________________________
```

## Adding a Deadline

To add a task with a deadline, use the `deadline` command followed by the task description and due date. You need to separate the task description and due date with the keyword `by`.

### Example:

`deadline assignment 1 by 12 Feb`

```
____________________________________________________________
Got it. I've added this task:
  [D][ ] assignment 1 (by: 12 Feb)
Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
____________________________________________________________
```
